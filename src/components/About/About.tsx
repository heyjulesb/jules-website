              I've recently started a career in Software Engineering as part of
              a career path change. Prior to the career change, I've been
              working in IT support for over 10 years, providing 1st/2nd line
              support to end users.
              <br />
              After spending 10 years working in this area, I felt Iâ€™d learned
              all I could learn and wanted to push myself even further, so I
              started to explore other different career paths within the IT
              industry.

              In February 2020, I signed up to an HTML and CSS introduction
              course, and I found myself enjoying creating my own one-page
              website. Aided by self-studying coding, completing courses with{' '}

              Futhermore, in June 2021, I signed up to the CFG Software
              Specialisation Nanodegree. This was a 12 weeks intensive coding
              course, specialising in Python. The course covered topics
              including: Object-Orientated Programming, algorithm design,
              libaries, data structures, API, debugging and testing. My place
              was sponsored by{' '}

              , who at the end of the Nanodegree offered a one year placement,
              as a Junior Software Engineer.
